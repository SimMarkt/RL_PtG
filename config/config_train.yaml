# parallel: Defines the computational setup for parallel execution: 
# - "Singleprocessing" (DummyVecEnv): Executes worker interactions sequentially; recommended for fast environments (e.g., ptg_gym_env.py)  
# - "Multiprocessing" (SubprocVecEnv): Executes worker interactions in parallel; ideal for computationally intensive environments
parallel : Singleprocessing
# train_or_eval: Specifies the mode of operation, whether training or evaluation:
# - "eval": Provides detailed state descriptions for evaluation purposes.
# - "train": Default setting for training; does not provide detailed state descriptions (recommended for training).
